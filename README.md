<h2>To make it a git repository you need to type command "git init"  then this will intialize the changes then turn into green color {untracked} </h2>

    <!--command  "git status" -->
    <!-- command "git add ." -->
    <!-- command "git commit -m and msg" -->
     <!-- command  "git branch -m main" -->
      <!-- command "git remote add origin https://github.com/Yash08official/Git_another_one.git" -->
       <!-- command "git push -u origin main" -->

       <!-- -u means i set it as a upstream branch . whenever i push plese go to this branch then we dont want to write  "origin main" again and again . {-u means settings main as my upstream branch} -->


 Now the changes we can do in feature2 branch it will not appear then we actually merge those changes 


 As in github we see "comapre and pull" when we click on it

 then this will show all the work done by feature2 branch

 In this we can add title , description what changes we will do and then we create pull request

 when we add pull request they can add reviewers from team some senior manegers , developers they will come and review your code and if they find evrything ok then they will approve the request otherwise they add comment like anything "fix the code"

 pull request means when you raise pull request that please merge my code into main branch and then someone from team going to review the changes after that everythinh is fine then you can merge this pull request

 and then you "confirm merge"

 your code has been merge and you will see it the code or work of feature2 in main branch


 but when we comeback to local machine "git or vscode" the code will not appear while we are on main branch I cannot see the changes 

 gor this i have command for local machine which is 

 "git pull origin main"

 pulling changes from remote to local repository 

 "origin" means remote repository

 so all the chaanges will
