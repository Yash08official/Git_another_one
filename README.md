<h2>To make it a git repository you need to type command "git init"  then this will intialize the changes then turn into green color {untracked} </h2>

    <!--command  "git status" -->
    <!-- command "git add ." -->
    <!-- command "git commit -m and msg" -->
     <!-- command  "git branch -m main" -->
      <!-- command "git remote add origin https://github.com/Yash08official/Git_another_one.git" -->
       <!-- command "git push -u origin main" -->

       <!-- -u means i set it as a upstream branch . whenever i push plese go to this branch then we dont want to write  "origin main" again and again . {-u means settings main as my upstream branch} -->


 Now the changes we can do in feature2 branch it will not appear then we actually merge those changes
